    "## What is No Limit Texas Hold'em About? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, a little background info is in order. The game is No Limit Texas Hold’em.  Played with a standard 52 card deck, Texas Hold’em is the most popular of all the poker variations.  Each player is dealt two cards to start the hand.  Each player will make the best five-card hand possible by using their two cards combined with the five community cards that are dealt throughout the hand.  The player to the left of the dealer button starts the action and play moves clockwise around the table.  The betting is typically started when the player to the left of the dealer button posts a small blind, and the next player to the left posts a big blind.  Betting action takes place on multiple streets: preflop, flop, turn, and the river.  Here are a few terms you should understand;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Button - The Button is a circular disk that gets passed around the table clockwise after each hand.  In a home game, the person who has the Button deals the hand dealing the first card to the player on their left.  At a casino, the Button identifies who is supposed to be the dealer, but the actual dealer is provided by the casino.\n",
    "- The Blinds - The Blinds are forced bets by the two players to the left of the Button.  They are called “Blinds” because the two players have to bet blind, in that they have to bet before they get to see their cards. \n",
    "- Streets - Each round that cards are dealt is referred to as a street. \n",
    "- Pre-Flop - This is the first betting round.  Each player is dealt two cards, and the blinds start the betting action.  No community cards have been dealt yet.\n",
    "- Flop - This is the second betting round.  In this round, three community cards are dealt face up in the middle of the table, followed by a round of betting.\n",
    "- Turn - In this round, only one community card is dealt, followed by the third round of betting.\n",
    "- The River - The final community card is dealt, followed by the last round of betting.\n",
    "- Showdown - After the River is dealt and all betting action has taken place, any remaining players Show their cards to see who has the best hand.\n",
    "- Check - If it’s a player's turn to act, and no previous bets have been made during that round of betting, the player can Check which means to choose not to bet, and allow the next player to take their turn.\n",
    "- Bet or Raise - Betting or Raising means to increase the size of the wager during a betting round.  The first player to put money in the pot each round is making a Bet.  If another player increases the size of the bet that round, they are making a Raise.\n",
    "- Call - If it’s a player’s turn to act and a bet has already been made during that round, the player can match the previous bet which is known as Calling the bet.\n",
    "- Fold - If it’s a player’s turn to act and a bet has already been made during that round, the player can give up and Fold their hand.  This player is no longer involved in the hand and losses any money they have put in the pot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve never played or are unfamiliar with poker terminology you can click [here](https://www.pokernews.com/poker-rules/texas-holdem.htm) for a concise but detailed explanation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime I ran into a situation while playing that confused me, I would mark the hand for review later. After my poker playing session was done, I'd go back through the hands that I'd marked for review and break them down mathematically so I'd have a better idea of what to do in each situation the next time it arose.  I picked out five hands from my poker career.  Using the statistics on my opponents that I had available at the time, I’ll explain my thought process.  Then you can analyze the hand using Python to determine which of your options offers the highest expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: *When reviewing poker hands, it is common to refer to our opponent as the \"Villain\" and ourselves as the \"Hero.\"*"

This means the Hero can win an additional \\$19.30 on top of the \\$3.70 already in the pot for a total of \\$23.00.*\n",
