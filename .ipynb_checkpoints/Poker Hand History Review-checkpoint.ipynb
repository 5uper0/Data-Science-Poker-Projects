    "In the business world, Data Science is used to make predictions and optimize decisions by creating machine learning models.  In online poker, the decision that needs to be made is whether to bet, call, or fold, but you aren’t allowed to use software to make that decision for you.  At most online poker sites, that is where the line is drawn in the rules.  This means that the model that must be trained is your brain, and the training is done away from the table with an endless stream of equity calculations.  Anytime I ran into a situation while playing that confused me, I would mark the hand for review later. After my poker playing session was done, I'd go back through the hands that I'd marked for review and break them down mathamatically so I'd have a better idea of what to do in each situation the next time it arose.\n",

    "- Hero bet 0.85 (Hero has 20.95 remaining);\n",
    "- Opponent (Villian) raises to 2.50 (Villian has 30.35 remaining);\n",
    "    - In poker termanology, this is called a 3bet.  The small blind and big blind make the first bet, and I raised them which was the second bet.\n",
    "- There is currently 3.70 Total in the Pot;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling is not a good option for reasons that are beyond the scope of this blog post.  We must decide between raising with the plan of going ‘All-In’ or folding.  Folding costs nothing so we will analyze the expected value of going all in.  In this situation, I’d make a small raise to induce my opponent to ‘All-in’ bluff, but we need to do the calculation as if I’m going ‘All-in’ since that is the plan, so;\n",
