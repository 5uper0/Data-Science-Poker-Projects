    "# Poker Probability and Statistics in Python Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Scientists create machine learning models to make predictions and optimize decisions. In online poker, the options are whether to bet, call, or fold.  You aren’t allowed to use software to make those decisions though. That's where most online poker sites draw the line in the rules. Since you can't train a machine learning model, you must train your brain. This requires an endless stream of equity calculations away from the poker table.  These equity calculations use many different probability and statistics concepts.  In Part 1 of this tutorial you’ll learn some of these concepts using a deck of cards and generic poker situations.  In Part 2 you’ll apply what you’ve learned to actual poker hands that I played during my career.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several years, beginning in 2010 I made a living playing online poker professionally. Data Science was a natural progression for me as it requires a similar skill-set as earning a profit from online poker. I wrote a blog about [what data science has in common with poker](https://medium.springboard.com/how-i-used-professional-poker-to-become-a-data-scientist-e49b75dfe8e3), and I mentioned that each time a poker hand is played at an online poker site, a hand history is generated.  These hand histories explain everything that each player did during that hand. I used software called [Hold’em Manager](https://holdemmanager.com/?a_aid=sharpdata) (think Tableau for poker) to take advantage of this data.  Hold'em Manager downloads each of these hand histories in real time to a PostgreSQL database so you can keep track of your opponent’s tendencies."

    "## Probability Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans are notoriously bad at intuitively understanding probability theory.  The concepts, however, are very important to for data science and predictive analytics.  Data science is about using data from events that have already occurred to predict future events.  Statistics makes sense the past, while probability theory helps predict the future.  More specifically, probability tells you how often, or the rate at which an event is likely to occur, given multiple trials of the event.  Understanding probability theory isn’t so difficult once you take a closer look.  First, a few things to keep in mind;\n",
    "\n",
    "- An experiment is a set of rules that governs a specific operation that is being performed;\n",
    "- A trial is the performance or exercise of that experiment;\n",
    "- An outcome is the result of a given trial;\n",
    "- An event is an outcome or any combination of outcomes;\n",
    "- The probability of an event is always between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating an event has no chance of occurring and 1 indicating an event will always occur.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the probability of an event occurring, divide the number of possible event outcomes by the sample space.  The sample space is defined as all the possible outcomes. \n"
